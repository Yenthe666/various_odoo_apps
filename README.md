## debug_data_details
Adds extra debugging features to instantly see all values known in the database for a specific record.<br/>
This is useful if you want to check which data is stored as quite a lot of fields are not shown in Odoo's UI.<br/>
This is accessible after activating developer mode by cicking on the 'debug' icon and clicking on the menu item "View all data":
